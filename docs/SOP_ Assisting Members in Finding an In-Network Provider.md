# **SOP: Assisting Members in Finding an In-Network Provider**

### **Purpose**

To guide call center or chat agents through the standardized process of helping a member locate an in-network provider while maintaining empathy, accuracy, and efficiency.

---

### **1\. Verification and Privacy**

**Objective:** Confirm member identity before accessing or sharing account information.

**Procedure:**

* If the chatbot has already authenticated the member, skip verification and proceed.  
* If the member is *unauthenticated*, verify using two identifiers (e.g., ZIP code and date of birth).

**Example Script:**

“Hello \[Member Name\], thank you for contacting \[Plan Name\]. How may I assist you today?”

“For your privacy, may I please confirm your ZIP code and date of birth?”

“Thank you for verifying that information.”

---

### **2\. Identify the Member’s Need**

**Objective:** Clarify what service or type of provider the member is seeking.

**Procedure:**

* Ask open-ended questions to understand their request.  
* Listen for details about provider type, prior facilities, and member preferences.

**Example Script:**

“Can you please tell me which service or type of test you’re looking for?”  
“I see you used Twin Lakes previously — are you looking for a similar imaging facility?”  
“Do you have a preferred city or ZIP code I should search near?”

**Tone Tip:**  
If the member is upset, acknowledge before proceeding:

“I understand that’s frustrating. Let’s find an in-network option that works for you.”

---

### **3\. Search for Providers**

**Objective:** Locate in-network providers based on the member’s service type and location.

**Procedure:**

* Use the plan’s provider directory or internal search tool.  
* Filter by:  
  * Specialty or service type (e.g., Diagnostic Radiology, Imaging)  
  * Location (member’s ZIP or city)  
  * Network status (in-network only)  
* Keep the member informed during the search.

**Example Script:**

“Please allow me a moment while I search for in-network providers in your area.”

---

### **4\. Present Provider Options**

**Objective:** Clearly communicate the provider options and applicable costs.

**Procedure:**

* Present a concise list of **3–5 nearby in-network providers**, including:  
  * Name  
  * Address  
  * Phone number  
  * Type of services offered (e.g., MRI, X-ray, Diagnostic Imaging)  
* If relevant, share plan benefit details briefly.

**Example Script:**

“Here are a few in-network imaging centers near you:  
• Carefirst Imaging — 4690 Clyde Morris Blvd, Port Orange, FL 32129 — (833) 862-7818  
• Port Orange Imaging Center — 1195 Dunlawton Ave, Port Orange, FL 32127 — (386) 322-1616  
• AdventHealth Imaging — 5821 S Williamson Blvd Ste 101, Port Orange, FL 32128 — (386) 231-2951”

“Your plan covers diagnostic radiology with a $0 copay at non-hospital facilities and $185 at hospital-based facilities. Out-of-network services have a 50% coinsurance.”

---

### **5\. Confirm the Member’s Specific Need**

**Objective:** Ensure the listed facilities perform the exact test or service needed.

**Procedure:**

* Confirm the member’s preferred service area before searching:  
  * Verify whether the member wants to use the ZIP code on file (XXXXX) or if they would like to search in a different area.  
  * If the member indicates a different area, collect the updated location information (ZIP code, city/state, or county).  
  * This ensures search results reflect the member’s current or preferred location — especially if they are visiting, recently moved, or have multiple residences.  
* **Example Script:**  
  “Before I search for providers, would you like me to use the ZIP code we have on file — XXXXX — or do you want to search in a different area?”  
  “If it’s a different area, can you please provide the ZIP code, city and state, or county where you’d like to look for providers?”

* Clarify the specific test (e.g., MRI, Barium Swallow, Ultrasound).  
* Confirm whether the provider offers that service.  
* If uncertain, instruct the member to confirm directly.

**Example Script:**

“Thank you for clarifying. A barium swallow test typically requires real-time X-ray. The imaging centers I listed above can perform that type of test.”

“Please contact the facility directly to confirm they perform the specific test you need.”

---

### **6\. Offer to Send the Information**

**Objective:** Ensure the member has a record of the provider options.

**Procedure:**

* Ask if the member would like the list mailed or emailed.  
* Verify the mailing address or email address.  
* Advise on delivery timeframe (8–10 business days for mail, 10-20min for the email).

**Example Script:**

“Would you like me to mail this list to you?”  
“Can you please verify your mailing address to make sure it’s correct?”  
“You should receive the list within 8–10 business days.”

---

### **7\. Provide Additional Resources**

**Objective:** Empower the member to find providers independently in the future, and provide the standard Disclaimer.

**Procedure:**

* Remind the member about online tools or self-service options.  
* Include the standard provider disclaimer.

**Example Script:**

“You can also search for providers anytime using the link on the back of your \[Plan Name\] ID card or by visiting \[PlanWebsite.com/findcare\].”

“**Provider Disclaimer:** We make updates to our provider lists six days a week (excluding Sunday). Updates may be affected by maintenance or outages. Please contact your provider before scheduling services to confirm participation.”

---

### **8\. Close the Interaction**

**Objective:** End the conversation professionally and courteously.

**Procedure:**

* Confirm the member’s issue is resolved.  
* Thank them for their time and provide closure.  
* Inform them about a possible survey if applicable.

**Example Script:**

“Is there anything else I can assist you with today?”  
“Thank you for being a valued \[Plan Name\] member. You may receive a short survey about your experience today — we appreciate your feedback. Have a great day\!”

### **Tone Standards**

* **Empathetic:** “I understand that’s frustrating — let’s find the best option for you.”  
* **Efficient:** Keep explanations short and focused.  
* **Professional:** Avoid speculation; rely on verified information.  
* **Reassuring:** Confirm next steps so the member feels supported.
