**Understanding Your Medicare Advantage (MA) Plan**

**Q:** What is a Medicare Advantage plan?  
**A:** A Medicare Advantage (MA) plan includes all your Part A and Part B benefits from Original Medicare and usually includes prescription drug coverage (Part D). It is offered by \[PlanName\], a Medicare-approved private insurance company. These plans often include extra benefits and services not covered by Original Medicare, such as dental, vision, hearing, or fitness programs. 

**Q:** What’s the difference between Original Medicare and my \[PlanName\] plan?  
**A:** Original Medicare is managed by the federal government and does not include extras like dental or vision. A \[PlanName\] Medicare Advantage plan combines your hospital (Part A), medical (Part B), and often drug coverage (Part D) into one plan, with additional benefits.

**Primary Care Provider (PCP)**

**Q:** What is a PCP and why do I need one?  
**A:** A Primary Care Provider (PCP) is the doctor you see for most of your healthcare needs. Your PCP helps coordinate your care, manage referrals to specialists, and monitor ongoing conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure. Having a PCP helps prevent emergency visits and hospital stays. 

**Q:** Can I keep my current doctor?  
**A:** If your doctor is in-network with your \[PlanName\] plan, you can usually keep them as your PCP. If they are not in-network, the plan can help you find another provider nearby. 

**Q:** How do I change my PCP?  
**A:** You can update your PCP anytime by logging into your secure member account at \[PlanWebsite.com\], or by calling the number on your member ID card.

**Prescription Drugs and Pharmacy**

**Q:** How do I know if my prescription drugs are covered?  
**A:** Each plan has a list of covered drugs called a “formulary.” You can look up your prescriptions online or ask the plan’s support line to check. 

**Q:** Can I use my regular pharmacy?  
**A:** Your plan has a network of pharmacies. You can use any in-network pharmacy, but some are designated as “preferred” pharmacies, which may have lower copays. 

**Q:** How does mail-order pharmacy work?  
**A:** You can get your medications delivered to your home through the plan’s mail-order pharmacy partner. Most mail-order prescriptions arrive within a few days. Call the number on your member ID card if your order doesn’t arrive on time. 

**Q:** What if my drug isn’t covered?  
**A:** Sometimes there are alternative drugs that are similar and covered. You can review the list of covered alternatives with your doctor or contact member services for help.

**Q:** What is the Healthy Home Visit program?

**Plan Operations and Enrollment**

**Q:** When can I change or disenroll from my plan?  
**A:** You can make one plan change during the Medicare Advantage Open Enrollment Period (Jan 1–Mar 31 each year). Some members qualify for a Special Enrollment Period (SEP) due to changes like moving, losing Medicaid, or gaining “Extra Help.” 

**Q:** What is “Extra Help” or LIS?  
**A:** The Low-Income Subsidy (LIS), or “Extra Help,” is a Medicare program that helps pay prescription costs for eligible members. The amount of help depends on your income level.
